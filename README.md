Planning a trip to a theme park shouldn't be hard! Why fight over what time to leave, what rides to ride and how to plan your day? We scraped information from around the web, and loaded it in a single source, to make planning your day almost as fun as the trip itself. Bubble plots make it easy to see top-ranked rides at each park, and interactive maps help you plan your perfect theme park strategy.
